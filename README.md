## 🎯 **Project Highlights**


- Developed a machine learning model using `XGBoost` to address `better risk assesment, enhance pricing strategies, and streamline claims processing`.
- Reduced `Mean Absolute Error by 40% `, demonstrating `less prediction errors` for `Allstate`.
- Enabled faster, fairer, and data-driven claims assessment for `Allstate`.
- Implemented `feature engineering and scaling` to improve accuracy.

## 👩🏽‍💻 **Setup and Installation**

**Provide step-by-step instructions so someone else can run your code and reproduce your results. Depending on your setup, include:**

* [Access the Google Drive with the dataset and Google Colab file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zt21JxIOPzPp8aMHYheBfVRQCZf8LwZb?usp=sharing)
* Download the dataset
* Open up Google Colab file
* Make sure the path in read_csv() matches the file location of your claims.csv file in your Drive (should be df.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/Allstate 1A/claims_data.csv"))
* Run the notebook
